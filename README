Before you continue, make sure you have a localhost set up on your machine

The master directory only contains "src" by default, which contains the web application library. For all intents and purposes I will refer to the master directory as "master".
Overview:
- "src/settings.json":        used to define desired folder structure for experiment
- "src/functions/":           contains all functions used. User will probably only need to edit "experiment.js"

You must provide the program your experimental folder structure in the "settings.json" file, stimuli within folders (mostly) of your choice defined in "settings.json", and the experimental block designs as JSON objects in your "blocks" directory, again, defined in "settings.json" 
JSON objects are heavily employed in this application. JSON objects are data structure composed of "keys" and corresponding "values" -- this relationshp is similar to the key-value relationship of maps in C++ or field-value relationship of structs in MatLab. This Wikipedia article provides a good introduction to JSON objects: 
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
You can use, "http://jsonlint.com/" to check that your json object is properly written. 

Structuring your "settings.json":
  This file contains a JSON object. The default JSON object is:
  {
    "primary" : "experiments/first/",
    "image" : "stimuli/image/",                            
    "audio" : "stimuli/audio/",
    "video" : "stimuli/video/",
    "text" : "stimuli/text/",
    "html" : "html/",
    "blocks" : "blocks/",
    "results" : "results/"
  }

  For example, the "image" directory would be "master/experiments/first/stimuli/image/"  (please remember to place a backslash at the end of each directory).
  You must provide the following keys:
  - "primary":            The main directory of your experiment -- all other directories are relative to this directory.
  - "html":               Where html file sare stores
  - "blocks":             Where experimental blocks are stored.
  - "results""            Where the results of the experimental blocks are stored
  Note: Both "blocks," and "html" require an "order.txt" file which contains the order of the experimental blocks, and of the primary instructions, respectively. Instructions corresponding to the blocks are not required in this file; they should be defined in the JSON object of their corresponding experimental block.
  You may add as many directories (each with a corresponding key) as you desire.


Setting up an experimental block as a JSON object:
This json object has 3 main keys (all of which are required): "instructions," "randomize," and "Trials". 

Block  - instructions:            Array of html files that will present the instructions for this block
      - randomize:                Boolean. True if you would like to randomize the trial presentation order
      - Trials:                   A 2-D array of the trials
          - Trials[0]:            Trial 1 (each trials is 1-D arrays of subevents)
            - Trials[0][0]:       subevent 1 (each subevent is a json object that produces some behavior from the experiment.)
            - Trials[0][1]:       subevent 2
            ...
            - Trials[0][n]:       subevent n+1
          - Trials[1]:            Trial 2
          ...
          - Trials[m]:            Trial m+1

Each sub-event (with the exception of "clear") is capable of presenting an object (media or text) to the user
For each sub-event, the following keys are required:
  - "eventType":                            6 predefined choices (can add your own)
  - "filename," if object presented is a file or "id," if otherwise
  - "type":                                 "media" or "text"
  - "tag":                                  HTML tag (e.g. img, audio, p, center, etc.)
  - "x":                                    x coordinate relative to left most edge
  - "y":                                    y coordiante relative to top most edge
  - "width":                                desired width of object. default options:
                                              - 
    ○ Not defined - preserves
    ○ "default" = 300px
    ○ provice Some number

Subevents and key requirements
  - Clear - clears objects on screen
    ○ "which" - array with the ids of the objects you would like to remove from screen ([id1, id2, …, idn]) or ["all"]  for all.
  - Timed - lasts a period of time
    ○ "duration" - length of time in milliseconds
  - Key - lasts until key press
    ○ "press" - which keys are acceptable (in an array) [key1, key2, …, keyn]
  - TimedKey - lasts period of time listening for a key press
    ○ "duration" - length of time in milliseconds
    ○ "press" - which keys are acceptable (in an array) [key1, key2, …, keyn]
  - TImedOrKey - lasts a period of time or until key press
    ○ "duration" - length of time in milliseconds
    ○ "press" - which keys are acceptable (in an array) [key1, key2, …, keyn]
  - Feedback - dependent on action of user in previous subevent, mimics defined subevent
    ○ "mimics" - which subevent you want to mimic (e.g. "Timed")
    ○ The other requirements of the subevent it is mimicing

The dimensions of the experiment window are 800 x 600. Plan your experiment around that
